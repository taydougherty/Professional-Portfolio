      <img src="images/picofme.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Taylor Dougherty and I live in Santa Monica. I was born in Canada and moved to the US for university. I went to Pepperdine University in Malibu and graduated with 3 bachelor's degrees in International Relations, French and Economics.</p>

      <p>I have a dog named Vienna and she is an Alaskan Klee Kai. She is 3 years old and loves to play and travel. She has been on 14 flights.</p>

      <p>My hobbies include concerts, travel and finding new restaurants in LA. I studied abroad in Switzerland my sophmore year and have been to over 20 countries on 4 continents. My favourite country is Denmark and the most exotic country I've been to is Morroco. This year I will be travelling to Thailand in the fall and it will be my first trip to Asia and my 5th continent.</p>
